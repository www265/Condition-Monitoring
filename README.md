Key Features:

Welcome Message: A friendly greeting that welcomes users and introduces the application.
Feature Highlights: Brief descriptions or icons highlighting key functionalities such as file upload, signal generation, and dimensionality reduction.
Navigation Links: Easy access to all main sections of the app for a seamless user experience.
File Upload (文件上传 - 画图)
Overview:
The File Upload page allows users to upload data files for analysis and visualization. Once uploaded, users can view graphical representations of their data, aiding in better understanding and interpretation.

Key Features:

File Selection: Users can select and upload files from their local system using a drag-and-drop interface or a file picker.
Data Preview: A preview pane shows the structure and initial content of the uploaded file, ensuring correctness before proceeding.
Graphical Visualization: After uploading, the system automatically generates visualizations such as line charts, bar graphs, scatter plots, etc., based on the data type and content.
Customization Options: Users can customize the appearance of the graphs, including colors, labels, axes, and more.
Signal Generator (信号生成器)
Overview:
The Signal Generator page is designed for creating and manipulating various types of signals used in signal processing tasks. This tool helps researchers and engineers generate synthetic data for testing algorithms or simulating real-world scenarios.

Key Features:

Signal Types: Support for generating different kinds of signals, such as sine waves, square waves, noise, etc.
Parameter Adjustment: Users can adjust parameters like frequency, amplitude, phase, and sampling rate to tailor the generated signals to specific requirements.
Preview Functionality: Real-time preview of the generated signal waveform, allowing users to see changes instantly.
Export Options: Generated signals can be exported in common formats for further analysis or integration into other systems.
Dimensionality Reduction (降维)
Overview:
The Dimensionality Reduction page provides tools and algorithms to reduce the number of random variables under consideration, often by obtaining a set of principal variables. This process is crucial for simplifying high-dimensional data while preserving important information.

Key Features:

Algorithm Selection: Users can choose from a variety of dimensionality reduction algorithms, such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis), t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), and autoencoders.
Parameter Tuning: Fine-tune algorithm parameters to optimize results for specific datasets.
Visualization: Visualize reduced dimensions through scatter plots, heatmaps, or other graphical methods to understand the underlying structure of the data.
Result Export: Save the reduced data and visualizations for use in reports or further analysis.
Summary
Each page within the application is designed to offer specialized functionality aimed at facilitating data analysis, signal processing, and advanced computational tasks. Together, they provide a comprehensive suite of tools for users to explore, manipulate, and visualize complex datasets efficiently.
